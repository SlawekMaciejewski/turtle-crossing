# THE PONG GAME
The old the Pong game from Atari using GUI from Turtle graphics. 
- The code was written to use documentations https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
- In this case, I was learning animation and OOP.

## Keys 
- Control the paddle by using:
  - the "UP", "DOWN" cursors for 1 player
  - and "W", "S" for 2 player
